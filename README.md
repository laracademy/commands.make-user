## Requirements

1. PHP 5.6+
2. Laravel 5.2+

## Usage

### Step 1: Install through Composer

```
composer require "laracademy/generators"
```

### Step 2: Add the Service Provider
The easiest method is to add the following into your `config/app.php` file

```php
Laracademy\Generators\GeneratorsServiceProvider::class
```

Depending on your set up you may want to only use these providers for development, so you don't update your `production` servers. Instead, add the provider in `app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php' like so

```php
public function register()
{
    if($this->app->environment() == 'local') {
        $this->app->register('\Laracademy\Generators\GeneratorsServiceProvider');
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Artisan Command
Now that we have added the generator to our project the last thing to do is run Laravel's Arisan command

```
php artisan
```

You will see the following in the list

```
generate:modelfromtable
```

## Commands

### generate:modelfromtable

This command will read your database table and generate a model based on that table structure. The fillable fields, casts, dates and even namespacing will be filled in automatically.

You can use this command to generate a single table, multiple tables or all of your tables at once.

This command comes with a bunch of different options, please see below for each parameter

* --table=
  * This parameter if filled in will generate a model for the given table.
   * You can also pass in a list of tables using comma separated values.
* --all
  * If this flag is present, then the table command will be ignored.
   * This will generate a model for **all** tables found in your database.
   * _please note that this command will only ignore the `migrations` table and no model will be generate for it_
* --connection=
  * by default if this option is omitted then the generate will use the default connection found in `config/database.php`
  * To specify a connection ensure that it exists in your `config/database.php` first.
* --folder=
  * by default all models are store in your _app/_ directory. If you wish to store them in another place you can provide the relative path from your base laravel application.
  * please see examples for more information
* --namespace=
  * by default all models will have the namespace of App
  * you can change the namespace by adding this option
* --debug
  * this shows some more information while running

## Examples

php artisan generate:modelfromtable --table=users
